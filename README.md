# Graduation-Project (Web-Based (ASP.Net MVC & C# & Firebase) and Android Application)
E-Voting System is needed nowadays in the shade of the transformation of all interactions between people to the Internet for their convenience and to protect them from epidemics and diseases. E-Voting system is an electoral system, in an electronic form, which means we won’t need paper voting in schools and will replace it with small machine that will be available everywhere. Giving citizens the right to vote at anytime and anywhere they want. This can be achieved using sources: First, through a website, which enables many operations such as: to check the ability to vote, search using national ID, view candidate ’s election programs, inquire for the nearest voting machine using address, check status of voting using national ID, fill a form to request a representative for voting at home “For disabled people” and follow up number of votes of each candidate, know who tops ranking.
Second, voting machines, which authenticate the citizen using her/his fingerprint to vote and choose a candidate from the list and vote for him/her.

The objectives of developing this system are:
Creating a reliable system that is easy to deal with, ensure the validity of the vote
for non-fraud, save citizens time, effort, and money.


# Functionality of System
For Website Application:
  - Check the ability to vote and status of voting using national ID.
  - View candidates' election programs.
  - Get nearest voting machine using address.
  - Fill a form to request a representative for voting at home for disabled People.
  - Search for a specific candidate.
  - Follow up number of votes of each candidate.
For Android Application:
  1) Functions in the Machine part
   - Authenticate the voter using his/her fingerprint to vote:
     This step will be done by putting the voter’s finger on the fingerprint scanner and the scanner processes it to validate if this 
     user has the right to vote or not. “by comparing the entered fingerprint with saved finger print for this citizen”
  2) Choose a candidate from the list & vote for him.
   - Through our reliable UI design, voter can scroll between candidates and choose one of them easily.
